# GitHub Workflow Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
- The GitHub workflow had YAML syntax errors, specifically on line 24
- There were two separate `if` conditions at the same level, causing a syntax error
- There were comment lines with `// filepath:` that GitHut Actions couldn't parse as valid YAML

## Changes Made

1. **Combined Duplicate `if` Conditions**
   - Merged the two separate if conditions into a single multi-line condition
   - Used the YAML multi-line string indicator (`>-`) for better readability

2. **Removed Filepath Comments**
   - Removed all instances of comment lines starting with `// filepath:`
   - These comments were added by tools but are not valid in GitHub Actions YAML

3. **Fixed YAML Formatting**
   - Used proper quoting around strings with special characters
   - Added proper spacing and indentation for improved readability
   - Ensured all YAML blocks were properly structured

## Before and After Example

**Before:**
```yaml
    # Skip if commit message contains any of these skip flags
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip ci]') && !contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[ci skip]')"

    # Skip workflow runs triggered by GitHub Actions bot commits
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip ci]') && !contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[ci skip]') && !contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[no ci]') && github.actor != 'github-actions[bot]' && github.actor != 'GitHub-Actions'"
```

**After:**
```yaml
    # Skip if commit message contains any of these skip flags or is from GitHub Actions
    if: >-
      !contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip ci]') &&
      !contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[ci skip]') &&
      !contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[no ci]') &&
      github.actor != 'github-actions[bot]' &&
      github.actor != 'GitHub-Actions'
```

## How to Test
The workflow file has been verified to be valid YAML. When pushed to GitHub, it should no longer produce syntax errors.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the workflow runs to ensure they execute correctly
2. Consider using GitHub's workflow validation tools like `actionlint` to catch issues before pushing
3. Update any scripts that automatically generate or modify workflow files to avoid adding invalid comment formats
