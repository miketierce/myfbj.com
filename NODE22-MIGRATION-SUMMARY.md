## Support and Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with Node.js 22 or PNPM 8, please refer to:
- NODE22-MIGRATION.md for detailed troubleshooting
- docs/NODE22-NATIVE-MODULE-FIXES.md for native module issues
- Run verification scripts to isolate potential compatibility issues:
  ```bash
  # Run comprehensive migration verification
  ./scripts/node22-migration-verify.sh

  # Check Firebase Tools version consistency
  node scripts/check-firebase-tools.js

  # Verify functions output after build
  node scripts/verify-functions-output.js

  # Fix native module issues in CI
  node scripts/ci-fix-modules.js
  ```
- For CI pipeline issues, check GitHub Actions logs and consider updating package overrides
- For deployment failures, verify all Firebase Tools versions match v14.6.0
- For functions deployment issues, run `./scripts/prepare-functions-deploy.sh` before deployment
- For native module issues, see troubleshooting in docs/NODE22-NATIVE-MODULE-FIXES.md
