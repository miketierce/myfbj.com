# 🚨 "Page Not Found" Error - Solution Guide

## Problem Diagnosis
Your Firebase Hosting site exists and deploys successfully, but shows "Page not found" when visited. This means the hosting is working but the **Firebase Function is not responding**.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Most Likely Issues (in order of probability):

### 1. **Function Deployment Failed** 🔴
- **Symptom**: Site exists, function doesn't exist in Firebase Console
- **Cause**: Function deployment step failed but didn't stop the workflow
- **Solution**: Check function deployment logs in GitHub Actions

### 2. **Function Name Mismatch** 🟡
- **Symptom**: Function exists but with wrong name
- **Cause**: Deployment target doesn't match firebase.json configuration
- **Expected**: Function name `server-dev-test`, Site points to `server-dev-test`
- **Solution**: Verify configure-firebase-branch.js output matches deployment target

### 3. **Function Runtime Error** 🟠
- **Symptom**: Function exists but returns errors
- **Cause**: Nuxt build issues, missing dependencies, or runtime errors
- **Solution**: Check Firebase Functions logs in Console

### 4. **Build Output Missing** 🔴
- **Symptom**: .output/server directory empty or malformed
- **Cause**: Nuxt build failed to generate Firebase function
- **Solution**: Check Nuxt build step for errors

## Debugging Steps Added

### ✅ **Enhanced Workflow Diagnostics**
The workflow now includes:

1. **Function Deployment Verification**:
   ```bash
   echo "🎯 Function deployment details:"
   echo "  Target: functions:server-dev-test"
   echo "  Expected function name: server-dev-test"
   firebase functions:list --project PROJECT_ID
   ```

2. **Post-Deployment Diagnosis**:
   ```bash
   bash ./scripts/diagnose-deployment.sh SITE_ID FUNCTION_NAME PROJECT_ID
   ```

3. **Live Site Testing**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://SITE_ID.web.app
   ```

### ✅ **Diagnostic Script**: `scripts/diagnose-deployment.sh`
This script checks:
- ✅ firebase.json configuration
- ✅ Build output (.output/server)
- ✅ Function existence in Firebase
- ✅ Site accessibility
- ✅ HTTP response codes

## Quick Fixes

### **If Function Deployment Failed**:
```yaml
# In GitHub Actions, look for:
❌ Function deployment failed
# Then check earlier in logs for:
Error: Build failed
Error: Package.json missing
Error: Dependencies not installed
```

### **If Function Name Mismatch**:
```bash
# Expected in firebase.json:
"function": "server-dev-test"

# Expected deployment target:
functions:server-dev-test

# Expected in Firebase Console:
Function name: server-dev-test
```

### **If Build Output Missing**:
```bash
# Check for these in GitHub Actions:
✅ .output/server directory exists
✅ .output/server/index.mjs exists
✅ .output/server/package.json exists
```

## Next Steps

### 1. **Push Updated Workflow**
The enhanced diagnostic steps will show exactly what's wrong:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add comprehensive deployment diagnostics"
git push origin dev-test
```

### 2. **Check GitHub Actions Output**
Look for the new diagnostic sections:

```
🔍 Running post-deployment diagnosis...
🎯 Function deployment details:
📋 Verifying deployed functions:
🌐 Testing site URL:
```

### 3. **Identify the Issue**
The diagnostics will show exactly which component failed:

```
✅ Hosting site exists: dev-test-devour4
❌ Function not found: server-dev-test
🔴 DIAGNOSIS: Site returns 404 - Function not responding
```

### 4. **Apply Targeted Fix**
Based on the diagnosis:
- **Function missing** → Fix function deployment
- **Wrong function name** → Fix configure script
- **Build failed** → Fix Nuxt build step
- **Runtime error** → Check Firebase Functions logs

## Expected Resolution

After the next deployment, you should see:
```
✅ Function exists: server-dev-test
✅ Site is working correctly
🌐 URL: https://dev-test-devour4.web.app
Response: 200
```

The enhanced diagnostics will pinpoint exactly what's causing the "Page not found" error so we can fix it immediately! 🎯
